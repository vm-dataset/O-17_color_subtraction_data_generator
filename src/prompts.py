#  DEFINE YOUR RUBRICS
# ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
#
# Rubrics are used to evaluate the quality of model outputs.
# 
# Important format requirements:
#   - Use natural language descriptions that align with human intuition
#   - Do NOT use numbered lists (e.g., "1. 2. 3.")
#   - Do NOT include points or percentages (e.g., "1 point", "40%")
#   - Should describe checkpoints like a human evaluator would
#
# Example style:
#   ✓ "Check if the final rotation angle and position match the expected result."
#   ✓ "Verify that the solution correctly identifies the checkmating move."
#   ✓ "Ensure the animation smoothly transitions from initial to final state."
#
#   ✗ "1. Correctness (4 points): ..."
#   ✗ "Award 1 point if counts match, 0 otherwise."
#   ✗ "Move Accuracy (40%): ..."
#
# You can define different rubrics for different task types.
